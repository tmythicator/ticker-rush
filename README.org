* Overview
Ticker Rush is a high-performance, real-time stock trading simulator with gamification elements.
Participants start with equal virtual budgets and compete by trading stocks and ETFs against each other and an autonomous AI agent.

The goal: maximize portfolio profit and climb the global leaderboard within a specific ladder season.

* Architecture
The project follows a polyglot microservices architecture to demonstrate scalability and modern engineering practices:

- *Frontend (The Terminal):* React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Lightweight Charts v5.
- *Backend (The Exchange):* Go (Golang) using Gin framework for high-concurrency WebSocket handling and order matching.
- *AI Agent (The Trader):* Python service for market analysis and automated trading strategies.
